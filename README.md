## About the Project :-
The Revenue Insights in Hospitality Using Power BI Project is designed to develop a comprehensive dashboard based on three months of data from a hospitality business that has been losing revenue and market share due to ineffective decision-making. This dashboard aims to empower stakeholders with the ability to make data-driven decisions, potentially leading to a 20% increase in overall revenue and market share.This Analysis aims to identify the total revenue corresponding to market and month, Occupancy % of different properties, and Average rating by customers in the different market areas with various room categories combined.


A few Metrics such as RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, SRN, DSRN, Realization, URN, BRN, Revenue, Cancellation, Capacity were thoroughly understood to utilize the true value of the data.

A Dynamic Dashboard was designed, to capture in-depth analysis of Pricing, Revenue, occupancy trends, a drill down analysis by region, individual properties, booking channels were provided to plan strategic move and regain the market share and revenue. 

Implementing stakeholders‚Äô thoughts into Dashboard through Domain Knowledge and Communication was Achieved.
## Key Metrics :-
1. **Revenue:**
  Measure the total revenue generated by AtliQ Grands.
2. **Average Rating:**
  Evaluate the average customer rating for the hotels.
1. **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room):**
   RevPAR is a key performance metric in the hospitality industry that calculates the average revenue earned per available room in a hotel over a specific period of time. It is widely used to assess a hotel's financial performance and efficiency in utilizing its available rooms to generate revenue.
2. **ADR (Average Daily Rate):**
   ADR refers to the average rental income earned for selling a hotel room per day. It is calculated by dividing the total room revenue by the number of rooms sold. ADR helps hotels determine their average pricing and is a crucial metric in revenue management strategies.
3. **DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights):**
   DBRN represents the total number of hotel rooms booked by guests within a single day. It measures occupancy and indicates how many rooms are reserved for a specific date. Hotel managers use DBRN data to forecast demand, optimize room allocation, and plan staffing levels.
4. **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):**
   DSRN refers to the total number of rooms available for sale in a hotel on a specific day. Unlike DBRN, which represents booked rooms, DSRN includes both rooms and rooms available but not yet booked. It provides insights into a hotel's inventory and helps manage room availability and pricing strategies.
5. **Realization %:**
   Realization % is a metric that reflects the efficiency of a hotel's booking and checkout processes. It is calculated by dividing the actual revenue earned from bookings by the potential revenue that could have been earned if all available rooms were sold at the optimal rate. A higher realization percentage indicates effective revenue management and operational efficiency.
6. **Occupancy %:**
    It represents the proportion of available rooms that are occupied or rented during a specific period of time,  expressed as a percentage.

# Data Modeling
Data modeling plays a pivotal role and serves as the foundation for generating meaningful reports. The entire framework of visualizations is constructed upon a well-designed data model. Neglecting proper data modeling can have adverse effects on the overall performance of the generated reports.

In the context of this project, we have meticulously followed the Snowflake data modeling method. This approach involves structuring data into normalized forms, resulting in reduced redundancy and improved query performance. This methodology enhances the way we organize and process data, ensuring optimal results for our analysis.

Remember, a robust data model is the cornerstone of effective data analysis and reporting. By employing sound data modeling practices, we can confidently generate insightful visualizations that empower data-driven decision-making.

# Creating calculated measures:

ADR Calculate the ADR (Average Daily rate). It is the ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked/sold. It is the measure of the average paid for rooms sold in a given time period.

`ADR = DIVIDE( [Revenue], [Total Bookings],0)`

Realization % calculates the realization percentage. It is nothing but the successful ‚Äúchecked out‚Äù percentage of overall bookings happened.

`Realisation % = 1- ([Cancellation %]+[No Show rate %])`

RevPAR Calculate the RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied. RevPAR helps hotels measure their revenue-generating performance to accurately price rooms. RevPAR can help hotels measure themselves against other properties or brands.

`RevPAR = DIVIDE([Revenue],[Total Capacity])`

DBRN calculates DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights). This metric tells on average how many rooms are booked for a day considering a time period.

`DBRN = DIVIDE([Total Bookings], [No of days])`

DSRN calculates DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights). This metric tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period.

`DSRN = DIVIDE([Total Capacity], [No of days])`
DURN calculate DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights). This metric tells on average how many rooms are successfully utilized by customers for a day considering a time period.

`DURN = DIVIDE([Total Checked Out],[No of days])`

Revenue WoW change % indicates revenue change percentage week over week.

`Revenue WoW Change % = 
    VAR selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]), SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]), MAX(dim_date[wn]))
    VAR revcw = CALCULATE([Revenue], dim_date[wn] = selv)
    VAR revpw = CALCULATE([Revenue], FILTER(ALL(dim_date), dim_date[wn] = selv - 1))
    RETURN DIVIDE(revcw, revpw, 0) - 1`

        
Occupancy WoW change % indicates occupancy change percentage week over week.

`Occupancy WoW change % = 
        Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))
        var revcw = CALCULATE([Occupancy %],dim_date[wn]= selv)
        var revpw = CALCULATE([Occupancy %],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1))
        return
        DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1`
        
ADR WoW change % helps to find the ADR (Average Daily rate) change percentage week over week.

`ADR WoW change % = 
        Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))
        var revcw = CALCULATE([ADR],dim_date[wn]= selv)
        var revpw = CALCULATE([ADR],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1))
        return
        DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1`
        
Cancellation % calculating the cancellation percentage.

`Cancellation % = DIVIDE([Total cancelled bookings],[Total Bookings])`

# Key Analysis :-
1.) Elite rooms have generated highest revenue by 554M with occupancy rate of 57.55%.

2.) Exotica Luxury properties generated highest revenue by 317M with an average rating of 3.62/5.

3.) Delhi has the highest occupancy and average rating of 60.44% and 3.78/5, whereas Mumbai generated highest revenue of 660M.

_By comparing occupancy rates, ADR (Average Daily Rate), and revenue metrics,  there is need  for dynamic pricing.  The analysis reveals that the hotel employs a flat pricing strategy, not differentiating rates for weekdays and weekends. There is the importance of adopting dynamic pricing strategies based on demand fluctuations to optimize revenue potential._
